This project is a simple and interactive web application designed to manage a farmstand's product offerings. It showcases my ability to work with Express and MongoDB, featuring essential functionalities like product listings, inventory management, and a user-friendly interface. While the app is a bit buggy, I am actively working on improving its performance. This project was developed as part of Colt Steele's web development course, which provided invaluable guidance and foundational knowledge in fullstack development.
